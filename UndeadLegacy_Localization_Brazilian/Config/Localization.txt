journalNutrition,"Staying Healthy in the wasteland is not an easy task, so here are some bullet points to get you started:\n\nYou have to balance 4 major nutrients: Fat, Carbohydrates (Carbs), Protein and Vitamins.\n\nFirst 3 determine your overall energy level (Calories). Vitamins determine strength of your immune system.\n\nAs long as Calories stay above 0 you are not dying and having 0 Vitamins isn't the end of the world, but you will be more susceptible to diseases.\n\nManaging all 4 nutrients above 75% will passively increase wellness. If any of 4 nutrients go below 25%, you will lose wellness.\n\nWellness can't go lower than 0 and each wellness point gives following bonuses:\n- Adds 1 to maximum Health\n- Adds 1 to maximum Stamina\n- Adds 1 to maximum carry weight\n- Adds 1% to Experience gain\n\nIf your body has 0 Calories, then you are dying and:\n- Any passive health regeneration is halted\n- Lose 2 Health every minute\n- Stamina regeneration speed slowed down\n- Stamina regeneration reduces maximum available stamina\n- Seek food intake immediately."
